      <p className='text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700'>

      <p className='text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700'>

        Failure to show up at the designated time and location without prior notice will be treated as a “no-show,” and no refunds will be issued.

      <h1 className='text-xl sm:text-2xl font-bold text-gray-800 mt-5'>3. Modifications Instead of Cancellation</h1>

      <p className='text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700'>
        In many cases, customers may opt to modify their bookings instead of canceling. Amendments are subject to availability and may incur additional charges depending on the nature of the change.

      <p className='text-base sm:text-lg text-gray-700'>
        In cases of natural disasters, political unrest, or other force majeure events, we will assess situations on a case-by-case basis. While we aim to be flexible, refunds will depend on recoveries from our vendors.
